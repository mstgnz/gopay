# GoPay

## Unified Payment Integration Service

GoPay is a modular payment integration service developed in Go. It abstracts different payment providers behind a single, standardized API, allowing developers to switch payment systems seamlessly without changing their codebase.

## Features

- **Unified API Interface**: Standardize diverse payment gateway APIs (Iyzico, OzanPay, Stripe, etc.) into a consistent format
- **Plug-and-Play Architecture**: Easily switch between payment providers without code changes
- **Provider Agnostic**: Add new payment gateways without disrupting existing implementations
- **Traceability**: Comprehensive logging with Elasticsearch integration
- **Microservice Ready**: Deploy as a standalone service in any architecture
- **Container Support**: Ready for Docker deployment with minimal configuration
- **Secure by Design**: Built-in callback authentication and security features

## Why GoPay?

Each payment provider implements their own unique API structure with different request formats, response schemas, and authentication methods. GoPay abstracts these differences away by:

1. Translating your standardized requests into provider-specific formats
2. Converting provider-specific responses into a consistent response format
3. Handling the complexities of each provider's authentication and security requirements

## Deployment

GoPay is designed to be self-hosted. Simply clone the repository and deploy it within your infrastructure.
